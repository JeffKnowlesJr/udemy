// code and you can't return inside of a subscription,
// you need to return synchronously,
// so that means you can't return in a place which will run sometime in the future.
// So what I'll do here instead is
// I will still return something but I will return the observable we're getting from the angular http
// client so that we can subscribe in the component where we are interested in that data.

// 1. In get posts, I want to reach out to my backend, fetch the posts,
// 2. store them in posts here and then
// 3. fire my update listener to inform everyone interested
