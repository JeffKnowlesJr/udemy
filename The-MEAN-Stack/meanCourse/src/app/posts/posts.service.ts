      // we need to inform our app and the other parts of our app about this update,
      this.postUpdated.next([...this.posts]);

    // the http client, this unsubscription will be handled for you by angular.

    // We switched to asynch updating by moving our push and update within subscribe callback

// 1. In get posts, I want to reach out to my backend, fetch the posts,
// 2. store them in posts here and then
// 3. fire my update listener to inform everyone interested
