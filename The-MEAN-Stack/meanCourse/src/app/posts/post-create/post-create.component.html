However post initially is undefined and we try to read a value from it here with ngModel
right from the start, this can be fixed by using the so-called elvis operator. In the template,
add a questionmark after post and this will force angular to check whether post exists before it
tries to read the title and it will populate this field with nothing
if the post does not exist and the same down there for the content.  -->

<!-- Another option is two - way binding, which combines the setting and reading of a value [()] -->
<!-- ngModel, an Angular directive, an instruction you place on an HTML element so angular knows WTD  -->
<!-- Local refrence add a variable to any element you want #postInput -->
<!-- Can be used here to pass data to onAddPost -->
<!-- Event binding is an angular feature which lets us listen to events in a declarative way () -->
<!-- String Interpolation, Property Binding, Event Binding, Two-Way Data Binding. -->
<!-- String interpolation can refer to a property or method {{}} -->
<!-- Property binding will target the property of the underlying object [] -->
<!-- We will use a combination of string interpolation for simple text usually between opening and closing tags -->
<!-- & Property binding always used directly on an element for outputting data in our template -->
